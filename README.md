# AI-Lie-detector
#Project Description
The AI Lie Detector aims to automate the detection of deception using artificial intelligence.
By analyzing behavioral cues such as voice tone, facial expressions, and/or written responses,
the system classifies responses as "Truth" or "Lie". This project blends machine learning,
computer vision, and natural language processing to provide a non-invasive and scalable lie
detection mechanism, offering a modern alternative to traditional polygraphs.
## Tech Stack
Layer Tools / Libraries
Programming Language Python
Audio Processing Librosa, OpenSMILE
Facial Recognition OpenCV, MediaPipe, dlib
Text Processing NLTK, spaCy, Transformers (BERT)
Modeling / AI TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
Visualization Matplotlib, Seaborn
Web Interface Streamlit, Flask
Deployment (optional) Heroku, Docker, AWS EC2 / Lambda
Data Storage Local filesystem, MongoDB (if needed)
## Workflow
Here’s how the AI lie detector works, step-by-step:
1. Input Acquisition
 User records voice or video
 Or types in text response
2. Preprocessing
 Voice: Extract MFCCs, pitch, energy levels
 Facial: Detect face, extract landmarks and expressions
 Text: Clean, tokenize, and convert to embeddings
3. Feature Extraction
 Use models to turn input into usable numerical data
o Example: MFCC vectors (voice), facial landmarks (image), BERT
embeddings (text)
4. Classification
 Trained neural network predicts:
o 0 → Truth
o 1 → Lie
5. Output Display
 The UI displays:
o Result: "Lie" or "Truth"
o Confidence Score (e.g., 87% confident)
## Future Use Cases
The AI Lie Detector can evolve into a powerful tool for various real-world applications:
1. Law Enforcement & Security
 Assist in criminal investigations
 Airport screening interviews
2. Corporate / HR Use
 Fraud detection in internal inquiries
 Behavioral analysis during interviews
3. Education / Exams
 Prevent cheating during online assessments
4. Healthcare
 Psychological assessments for behavioral disorders
5. Public Safety
 Real-time threat detection from social media/text/video input
6. Social Research
 Studying human behavior under different contexts
